The Book E-commerce Platform is a user-focused web application designed to streamline the
online buying and selling of books by enabling direct interaction between authors and readers.
This eliminates the need for intermediaries, helping authors maximize profits and giving readers
access to a broader, potentially more affordable book selection. The platform supports three
primary user roles: buyers, sellers (authors), and administrators, each with role-specific features
and interfaces. The backend is powered by Django, a robust Python framework that handles
business logic, database operations, and admin management, while the frontend is developed
using React and Vite to deliver a fast, dynamic, and modular user experience. Tailwind CSS is
used to ensure a clean, responsive design across devices. Firebase is integrated into the frontend
to provide secure and real-time user authentication, complementing Django's backend logic.
MySQL serves as the relational database, managing all user, book, and transaction data efficiently.
Core features include user registration, login, categorized book browsing, cart functionality for
multi-book checkout, and a seller dashboard for managing inventory and tracking sales. The
system is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements such as user
reviews, book recommendations, digital downloads, and ratings. Overall, the platform offers a
modern, feature-rich solution for transforming how books are bought and sold online.
